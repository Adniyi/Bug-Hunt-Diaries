# Bug Hunt Diaries

**Bug Hunt Diaries** is a personal blog and portfolio site built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the popular [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme. This blog is a space for sharing knowledge, documenting projects, and learning through building â€” one bug at a time.

## About the Author

Hey! Iâ€™m David Adewumi â€” a developer, learner, and coffee-fueled keyboard warrior focused on sharpening skills in Python, JavaScript, Hugo, PHP, Vue, and more. This blog is where I share what Iâ€™m learning, document projects, and write tutorials to help myself and others grow.

My mission is to stay curious, make things that matter (even if small), and always leave room to laugh at my own bugs.
