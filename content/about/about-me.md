title: 'About Me'
---

Hey! I’m David Adewumi —a developer, learner, and coffee-fueled keyboard warrior building this blog one `git commit` at a time.

Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my skills in:

- 🛠️ Python, JavaScript, Hugo, PHP, Vue
- 🧠 Learning more about [APIs, fullstack development, system design]
- 🔨 Building projects that break and (eventually) work

This blog is a space for me to share what I’m learning, document what I’ve built, and write posts that help me (and hopefully others) understand things better.

### My mission (besides getting better at coding)

To stay curious, make things that matter (even if they’re small), and always leave room to laugh at my own bugs.

If you're a fellow dev, learner, or someone curious about my work, feel free to explore my posts or reach out—I'm always up for a good tech convo.
