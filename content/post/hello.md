Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I document the things I build, break, and learn while navigating the weird and wonderful world of software development.

I’m David Adewumi, a developer-in-progress with a passion for solving problems, writing code, and sometimes yelling at my terminal until things start working again.

### So... why this blog?

Good question. This blog is my way of:

- Practicing “learning in public”
- Showing off some cool projects (and the mess behind them)
- Writing things down so future-me doesn’t repeat current-me’s mistakes
- Creating something I can share with recruiters, mentors, and fellow devs

### What to expect here

You’ll find:
- Side projects and breakdowns of how I built them
- Little discoveries, big bugs, and what I learned from them
- Posts that explain things I just figured out
- Maybe a meme or two (because debugging deserves emotional support)

### TL;DR

I’m not an expert (yet), but I’m serious about getting better—while keeping things fun and a little chaotic. If you're into dev blogs that mix curiosity, code, and caffeine-fueled breakthroughs, stick around.

Thanks for stopping by—and if you’ve got feedback, ideas, or cool bugs to trade, I’d love to connect!

Stay curious,
**David Adewumi**
