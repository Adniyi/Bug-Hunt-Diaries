With just a few lines of code, you can spin up a simple web app and start building actual stuff.\nIn this post, we’ll talk about:\nWhat web frameworks are (and why you should care) What makes Flask so special How to get started with a simple “Hello World” app Let’s dive in. 🐍\n🤔 What Are Web Frameworks? Flask is a web framework. But what even is a web framework?\nIn simple terms, a web framework is a toolbox that helps developers build websites and web apps faster and with less pain.\nSure, if you’re building a basic personal page, some HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript might be enough. But once you want things like:\nUser accounts Messaging between users Session management Dynamic content … things get complicated—fast.\nA web framework handles all the annoying plumbing behind the scenes so you can focus on building features, not reinventing the wheel.\nThere are frontend frameworks (like React or Vue) and backend frameworks (like Flask or Django). Flask falls into the backend camp—it helps you build the part of the website users don’t see, but that does all the heavy lifting.\n🧪 So, What Is Flask? Flask is a Python-based micro web framework created by Armin Ronacher (legend). It was inspired by another framework called Bottle, which explains their similar minimalist vibes.\nWhat makes Flask great?\nIt’s lightweight and unopinionated: you choose what you want to use, nothing is forced on you. It’s easy to get started with: great for beginners. It’s powerful enough for real-world apps: many big projects started with Flask. It also has a rich ecosystem of extensions, including:\nFlask-Login for user authentication Flask-SQLAlchemy for working with databases Flask-Session for session management And the best part? If you know Python basics (functions, decorators, maybe some classes), you’re good to go.\n🧰 Getting Started with Flask Let’s create a simple Flask app that says \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; when you open it in the browser.\n✅ Step 1: Set up your project First, create a new folder for your Flask app.\nMake sure you have:\nPython installed on your system (and added to your PATH) A terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Bash… pick your flavor) ✅ Step 1: Create and activate a virtual environment: Windows\npython -m venv venv .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate macOS/Linux\npython3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate ✅Step 2: Inside the activated virtual environment, run: pip install flask ✅ Step 3: Write your first Flask app In main.py, paste this:\nfrom flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) def hello_world(): return \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; if __name__ == \u0026#34;__main__\u0026#34;: app.run(debug=True) Now run the file:\npython main.py Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000.\nBoom. 🎉 You’ve just created your first Flask app.\n📚 Where to Learn More Want to go deeper?
